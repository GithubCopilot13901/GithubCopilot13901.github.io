//I want you to act as a web developer expert. I want you to create for me Bryce’s Bait and Tackle company’s website. The website has a colourful background, home, product, and buttons in the header, image and description of Bryce’s Bair and Tackle. Make it look like a video game where each product is an upgrade. Make the website look nice. I need all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file.
